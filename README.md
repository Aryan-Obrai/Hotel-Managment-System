## Project Description

The Hotel Management System utilizes Java and SQL to create a terminal-based database interface. This system enables users to perform standard hotel management operations such as booking rooms, making reservations, requesting repairs, managing staff, and locating hotels with available rooms. The system's architecture is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, allowing users to quickly and efficiently manage their hotel data. The booking and reservation systems are optimized for performance and reliability, while the maintenance tracking and reporting features provide hoteliers with valuable insights to improve their operations. Use of indexing resulted in faster queries and reduced system load.
